npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion react-icons react-apexcharts

Remove the unused packages: @emotion/styled and framer-motion. These packages are no longer required in Chakra UI.
npm uninstall @emotion/styled framer-motion

import { Provider } from '@/components/ui/provider';
according to chatgpt this is a place holder in the chakra UI documentation and not an antual import. ChakraProvider must still be used.
ChatGPT : 'This is not from Chakra at all â€” it's a placeholder for your own custom wrapper. This Provider is assumed to be a file you created in your own src/components/ui/provider.jsx or similar.

It's not part of Chakra UI â€” the docs just expect you to figure that out ðŸ˜©.'

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
